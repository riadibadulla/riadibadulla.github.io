### Education
<hr />

**PhD, Computer Science**  
City, University of London (2020 - 2024)

- Thesis: Effect of High-resolution training in optical neural networks
- My research is focused on the optimisation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the use of Vision Transformers in the development of Optical AI accelerators.
- A pivotal part of this research involves leveraging the high-resolution capabilities of optics to enhance feature maps and kernels while minimising the number of channels in CNNs.
- A significant milestone in this research was the development and implementation of a novel architecture, the 'FatNet Transformation', which integrates CNNs and Vision Transformers in a unique way.

**MSc, Artificial Intelligence (Merit)**  
University of St Andrews (2018 - 2019) 

- Relevant Modules: Object-Oriented Modelling, Design Programming(16.9/20); Articial Intelligence Practice(16.4/20); Natural Language Processing(12/20); Software Engineering Practice(16.6/20); Machine Learning(13.2/20)...
- Thesis: Simplex Optimisation for Aerial Image Stitching (16.5/20)
  * The research aimed to address the issue of data loss in image stitching techniques, like Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), with the goal of enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of aerial image stitching.
  * Affine transformations were integrated with simplex optimisation methods to propose an improved technique for determining the optimal homography for image alignment.
- Overall Grade: 14.4/20

**BEng, Computer Systems Engineering (First Class Honours)**   
City, University of London (2015 - 2018)

- Relevant Modules: Programming and Design (77), Engineering Mathematics (93), Engineering Mathematics2(80.4), Object-Oriented Programming (81.4), Computer Systems and Networks (68.2), Java Programming (88.8)...
- Thesis: Estimating Hyperparameters of LSTM in Speech Recognition (72.5)  
- Overall Grade: 74.14 (1st)

### Achievements
<hr />

##First Place in Hackathon hosted by the data science team of 10 Downing Street, Evidence House (2023) 
We have developed a tool that can potentially replace the modern ministerial red boxes in the government, to make the work of private secretaries and ministers more ecient. We have presented our work to Minister Alex Burghart.

##Scholarship of State Program on Education of Azerbaijani Youth Abroad (2014)
I have been awarded the scholarship, which covered my full tuition fee, living cost and visa expenses. I have passed an interview and was chosen from several hundred students in Azerbaijan.
