I am a deep learning engineer and PhD candidate with experience applying AI and optics. I completed my BEng Computer Systems Engineering from City University before obtaining my MSc in Artificial Intelligence from the University of St Andrews. My master's dissertation focused on aerial image stitching using simplex optimization. After my MSc, I worked for a year as a Deep Learning Engineer at Optalysys, where I focused on integrating optical hardware and CNNs to accelerate AI inferencing. My academic research has centered around computer vision problems like image classification and segmentation. I have published some novel techniques, including an architecture called 'FatNet Transformation'. I am currently continuing my PhD studies at City University London. With my engineering background and research interests, I aim to advance innovations in deep learning and computer vision through both industry experience and academic studies.
